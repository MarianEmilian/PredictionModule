{"headline": "Gary Gensler Confirmed As New SEC Chair As Agency Tackles GameStop Saga, ESG Boom And Cryptocurrency", "date": "Apr 14, 2021,", "company": "gamestop", "blog_id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/6438-6074b61dccd4f30006854b1d", "paragraphs": ["Gary Gensler, the recently approved chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, will have his hands full as he looks to tackle the key issues of the moment including ESG investing, cryptocurrency, order routing and a fiduciary standard for brokers.", "Gensler, who previously served as chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, was approved by the United States Senate on April 14 after a delay . Industry sources say he brings a reputation as an \u201cextremely active regulator\u201d having made it clear in his nomination hearing before the Senate Banking Committee in early March that additional disclosure requirements will be key to his approach to these pressing issues.", "Kirkland & Ellis partner Norm Champ says that increased disclosure around ESG investing should be expected following the recent announcement of a Climate and ESG task force at the SEC led by Acting Deputy Director of Enforcement,\u00a0Kelly Gibson. Champ expects more onerous requirements for companies to disclose how they are handling climate risk as well as diversity. While ESG investing has exploded over the past decade, there has been scrutiny over a lack of oversight of late as its popularity continues to swell.", "Gensler will bring experience from his career in academia to bear, coming to the SEC from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management where he was a professor of the practice of global economics and management. He also served as co-director of a fintech group at the school as well as a senior advisor to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative in between his two stints running financial regulators.", "The financial services industry is still looking for a cohesive approach on the categorization of digital assets, which depending on the regulatory body has been considered a commodity, property, currency and a security.", "While issues like ESG and cryptocurrency have been building in prominence and were certain to be top of mind for the next chair, the GameStop stock rally earlier this year fueled by Reddit thrusts issues around online brokerages and order flow onto Gensler\u2019s docket.", "He will also be the latest head of the SEC to tackle the longstanding search for a clear fiduciary standard for financial advisors and broker-dealers that has been kicked back and forth between the SEC and the Department of Labor for a decade. He will likely work on that issue with Martin Walsh, the former Mayor of Boston who was confirmed as President Joe Biden\u2019s pick for Labor Secretary last month. ", "The question remains whether he will strengthen the current law of the land, Regulation Best Interest, through an increased disclosure requirement or take on the larger task of reopening the longstanding debate by taking another look at the definition of fiduciary duty.", "When Gensler ran the Commodity Futures Trading Commission he was active in rulemaking, issuing more than 40 rules and only having one struck down by the courts. Many of the issues he is set to tackle were already on the radar of the SEC under Acting Chair Allison Herren Lee. The exam division featured ESG, climate risks and Reg. BI compliance in its 2021 priorities released earlier this year. Lee said the commission plans to look at order flow payments in a Feb. 25 response to a letter from Senator Elizabeth Warren.", "For now there is not much worry in financial services about the new leadership at the SEC, according to Champ, who spent nearly five years at the SEC serving as director of the Division of Investment Management, deputy director of the Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations and the associate regional director for examinations in the regional office located in New York.", "If Gensler surprised the industry by proposing the types of regulations championed by the likes of Senator Warren or others progressive lawmakers, it could cause panic, Champ admits. \u201cPeople are taking a wait-and-see approach,\u201d he says. ", "That being said, Champ says that he is a contrarian when it comes to the narrative that there will be some seismic shift in SEC presence between the previous and current administrations.\u00a0", "\u201cYes, the Trump administration was deregulatory but from an enforcement and examination perspective, the SEC was incredibly active over the last four years. It is really a disservice to the staff to say otherwise,\u201d\u00a0 Champ adds. \u201cThis narrative that there's going to be some big change in\u00a0examination and enforcement is way overblown. There will certainly be more rules, but from the policing perspective the SEC has been pretty darn active.\u201d", "However, one area where Champ expects to see a large change from the previous regime is the reemergence of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, created in the aftermath of the financial crisis as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, in order to identify and monitor excessive risks in the U.S. financial system. Gensler was active in supporting the council in his time at the CFTC and Champ concedes that the group housed within the Department of Treasury has been \u201cdormant\u201d over the past few years.", "His advocacy for a revival of FSOC will be aided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, another agency created by Dodd-Frank that is likely to see a revival under the current administration. President Biden has nominated Rohit Chopra to the post, an acolyte of Senator Warren who helped create the bureau. The head of the CFPB, along with Gensler\u2019s last two federal posts, chairs of the CFTC and SEC, are among the 10 voting members on FSOC.", "During his confirmation process, Gensler has not indicated his preferences to lead the five largest division within the commission, the Division of Enforcement, the Division of Corporation Finance, the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, the\u00a0 Division of Trading and Markets and the Division of Investment Management. Once he is confirmed, Champ expects names to emerge for those posts and with that more clarity about the tenor of his tenure."], "clicks": 14507},

So, what's next for GameStop?", "There are three components to examine for the answer to that question: Fundamental expectations, valuation criteria and stock trading possibilities. ", "GameStop's fundamental expectations are improved.", " The key ingredient is the enhanced focus on a growth strategy, spurred by the new, committed board members and fostered by new management additions capable of improving on a known brand name. Thus, GameStop is on a higher plane than when it sold for $3-5 based on the view of a weak post-Covid rebound. ", "GameStop benefits from stock market's current valuation criteria.", " In a market focused on rapid growth, favored valuation metrics go beyond earnings and sales. Those classic value measures can be misleading when a company is rapidly building its brand, products/services, locations, marketing, delivery, patents, acquisitions, etc. ", "Note: There are many companies currently in or joining this rapid growth category (e.g., the electric vehicle industry). Often, their sales are low and earnings are negative, and yet their stock prices are high and rising. \"Crazy\" investors? No, quite the opposite. It's the realization that implementing a growth strategy successfully means the payoff will come later.", "GameStop stock trading possibilities are improved. ", "When a stock is supported by non-classic valuation criteria, stock trading assumes a more important role. When a technical picture (stock chart) has familiar elements, investors are more willing to buy and hold. The trader activity helps create a robust market for the stock, thereby providing both liquidity and a visible, accepted price range.", "The current drawback: It's early days for GameStop \u2013 the company and the stock", "GameStop, the stock, just finished a wild race. This overheated engine is knocking and pinging now, trying to find a smooth, idling speed. That transition requires three ingredients: supportive fundamental news, desirable valuation measures and a confidence-building technical picture. ", "The next step is to hear about GameStop's actual plans and strategies. Likely, these will be discussed on the March earnings conference call. From that information, investors and analysts can develop expectations of where the company is headed and what the important growth criteria should be.", "The good news: A selling washout is likely", "As to the technical picture, some information is now at hand. However, the picture still contains abnormal moves and investor/trader actions. With the previous higher prices still fresh in investors' minds, there are two remaining, unstable shareholder groups: \"Hangers-on,\" who hope for a recovery (often to get back to even so as to avoid taking a loss), and \"reentrants,\" who view the current price as comparatively cheap and, therefore, hope for a repeat run-up. When the stock continues to stagnate or decline, these shareholders will sell. ", "That final selling helps establish a price foundation that becomes visible as other investors begin buying. At that point, the stock can trade without extreme moves, affirming that the previous wildness is washed out.", "The following graphs provide four different views of GameStop\u2019s stock action.", "The bottom line", "GameStop has the potential of becoming a reconstructed growth stock. However, two developments need to occur to make the potential real:", "So, patience seems the best strategy now. Hopefully, good things will happen. It's always exciting to see a company reposition itself for the next growth uptrend instead of being mired in the past and fading away."], "clicks": 7211},

Part of this had to do with their belief that such a buying flurry would force \u201cshort sellers,\u201d investors who aim to make money when a stock\u2019s price falls instead of rises, buy the stock back to \u201ccover their shorts,\u201d perpetuating the stock\u2019s rise. ", "To steal a line from the show \u201cSchool of Rock,\u201d what a way to stick it to the man! In this case, the \u201cman\u201d was one or more hedge fund managers who were known to have been short the stock. You can read all about this to your heart\u2019s content elsewhere on Forbes.com. ", "For me, the irony is that at the same time this unique type of crowd-funding effort to break hedge fund managers was happening, there was another story brewing, way over in the bond market. Long-term interest rates were doing their best meme-stock impersonation, and moving up at a historically-rapid rate. ", "The 10-year U.S. Treasury rose from 0.50% in the middle of last year, to a recent peak of about 1.60% in late February. Much of that surge came in just a couple of weeks. ", "This was enough to put the normally sleepy bond market on the front pages of the financial news. I was glad to see this, if for no other reason than what it means at this type of peak euphoria for day-trading and other Dot-Com Bubble era habits that investors adopt.", "After all, trading is for traders, and investing is for investors. There is some crossover, but I lament the fact that in 2021, few market participants can tell the difference. This sows the seeds of eventual regret. As the old expression goes, one definition of a long-term investor is a disappointed speculator.", "It is not surprising to see that the spike in Treasury rates and the manic activity in Gamestop and other stocks come at the same time. This is the era we live in, where any investment can go from calm to hyperactive in days. ", "There is also a \u201cman\u201d that investors may be \u201csticking it to\u201d when it comes to the lift in Treasury rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve sets very short-term interest rates. Who sets the rates on 10-year, 20-year and 30-year bonds? The bond market! So, perhaps the message in what we see in bonds lately is this: Hey Fed, if you won\u2019t do something to stop suppressing interest rates and return the economy to some normalcy, we, the bond market, will!", "Like Jack Black\u2019s classroom full of kids in the movie version of School of Rock, the atmosphere is increasingly charged up. That should put every investor on notice. ", "This sets up for potentially the best investment climate in recent memory, IF you can do two things that most investors have yet to focus on sufficiently. First, develop a strategy for hedging portfolios. Second, embrace a process for managing a portion of your portfolio tactically. That is, a process whereby you \u201crent\u201d investments for weeks or months instead of \u201cowning them\u201d for years. ", "It seems to me that the investment world focuses too much attention on both \u201cbuy and hold forever\u201d approaches and very short-term (minutes/hours/days) than the types that occupy the middle. Today\u2019s markets operate differently. There are different players, different motivations and social media and technology to disrupt the old rules.", "This calls for enhancing your approach with a mentality that includes succeeding in that middle time frame of weeks to months, and doing all you can to avoid major drawdowns in value along the way. It is in the middle that so much of the profits may be made in the period ahead. And since Gamestop, Treasury Bonds and other market trends are increasingly part of this new wave of investment activity, it behooves us to better understand it.", "In the bond market?\u00a0Same thing, different investing group!\u00a0In that case it is the bond market essentially telling the Fed that if the Central Bank continues to do nothing about suppressed interest rates, rising commodity prices, and endless government spending, they will.\u00a0As I noted in my last article, the Fed controls overnight rates, but the bond market determines the rate of the benchmark 10-year Treasury Bond, and the 30-year Treasury Bond that so many mortgages are tied to.", "\u00a0", "The power of the herd is not a Gamestop story.\u00a0It\u2019s the story of a market that has been pushed to the limit, bubbled up across stocks, bonds, corporate debt, government debt, consumer debt and now, speculative investor excess.\u00a0", "\u00a0", "For meme stock holders, they risk a quick return to reality.\u00a0For bond investors and 60/40 allocation fans, it is just the opposite.\u00a0It might just be the long overdue\u00a0reversion to the mean for the bond and stock markets.\u00a0For financial advisors, they either get in sync with that possibility and start learning how to navigate through it, or they will be hearing the phrase \"career risk\" a lot, the same way over-leveraged hedge fund managers do when bubbles pop.", "Comments provided are informational only, not individual investment advice or recommendations.

If you were off grid for the last month, and are not up to date on this story, there are hundreds of articles out there that describe the circumstance of how small retail investors got together on a little known internet forum called \u201cwallstreetbets\u201d and ultimately drove interest and pricing on GameStop\u2019s public stock to unexpected highs. The GameStop stock (Stock Symbol: GME) ended last year near $18 a share but soared as high as $483 in late January 2021. After falling back and trading below $40, the stock then jumped back up in a \u201cRound 2\u201d ramp\u2014along with other popular stocks targeted on Reddit\u2014to $194.50 as of this writing.\u00a0", "Many at Wall Street hedge funds were caught in short selling positions, having to cover the differences in prices between the low price they bet on in their \u201cput\u201d options, and the actual price as their options were set to expire. This forced the hand of the hedge funds involved to \u201ccover\u201d their short bets, and purchase the stock at very high prices. One of the hedge funds, Melvin Capital, lost 53% of its value, and had to receive an emergency cash infusion of $2.75 billion. Needless to say, these activities cost these hedge funds billions of dollars as the damage reports and aftermath are still coming in. In a recent article \u201c", "Warnings For Tech Giants And An Ode To A Simpler Web", ",\u201d I called out the ongoing threat of bots and lack of authenticity that is pervasive across platforms such as social networks and forums such as Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc. This is an identity and integrity problem that has the potential to cause untold damage in addition to posing an experience issue.", "The GameStop episode has been labeled as a showdown between Wall Street and Main Street.

The roots of these circumstances within the forum dated back to the middle of 2020, when interest in GameStop investment began to gather momentum.\u00a0", "Major investment firms followed the track of publicizing the expectations that the stock would soon be worthless, in a story similar to Blockbuster Video. Typically, this is something they can make true through the presence of investment movement and the open positions that occur when this happens. When the short sales options became due and the price did not match expectations, the hedge funds who expected to win lost big.", "Before long, \u201cBig Tech\u201d intervened with a heavy hand as it has been doing lately, shutting down forums and conversations in places where they popped up. Trading firms, such RobinHood, E*Trade, and others even stopped and curtailed trading in the stock. This saga rose to such prominence, that culminated with hearings in front of Congress.\u00a0 However, those hearings were a late damage control response attempt that neglects a major issue affecting the majority of experiences on the web nowadays, which is lack of authenticity. Congress, along with \u201cBig Tech,\u201d still missed that point for whatever reason.", "The openness of the social media platforms to malfeasance is a persistent issue.

These bots open the door to threats that include:", "As a population, we have a pretty good handle on malicious email activities, but bot activity must be brought into check now\u00a0 especially in online forums and social media. There seems to be a lack of will by companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit to do so.\u00a0 With a lack of measures to assure a genuine base of users, trolls and opportunists will leverage any crack possible to jump into the stream and corrupt conversations to their needs. Every account should be validated and traced to an actual individual and in obvious cases, an actual business or organization. What we are seeing is the product of nothing but purposeful neglect and a gap in the mission of what online interactions were built for.\u00a0", "It is time to gather around the principles of \u201cwho\u201d these platforms are for. Are online forums designed around the experience of having shapeless, anonymous bots consuming online engagements? Can the same be said for social networks? Do you have any idea who is behind the public comments that drop into your Twitter posts? Many people think they do, but the simple fact is that we engage in a virtual world where there is little validation and the experiences we engage in may not be human or genuine in nature.\u00a0", "The GameStop situation clearly illustrated that major networks and forums should be regarded as potential risk points. Every one of these risk points should be contextualized in terms of impact and the effort required to ensure a genuine experience and open exchange of ideas. Various technologies can help the effort towards a genuine web. For example, multi-factor authentication, account validation, biometrics, preemptive security monitoring, and other leading technologies provide ways to do this on financial websites. It would only take the will of the social media\u00a0 giants (with the help of technology) to improve the experiences and impact of these public meeting places in a positive manner.

Bill Ackman's billion-dollar short\u00a0", "bet against Herbalife", "\u00a0is another iconic example of such a fight. In recent months, the trading frenzy at GameStop (", "GME", ") has again prompted a lot of discussions on the role of short sellers in the market. Despite the common narrative that short sellers are to blame for stock market manipulation and price decline, a healthy dose of short selling is vital for well-functioning capital markets.\u00a0", "An efficient capital market, where prices reflect accurate information about the company's fundamentals, allows CFOs to raise funds at an attractive price in the long run. Informationally efficient capital markets are also good at allocating capital to its best use: giving money to fundamentally strong firms while rationing it for the weak ones. Short sellers make an important contribution in making prices efficient, and therefore in the efficient allocation of capital across firms.", "Since the short sellers profit from a price decline, they have strong incentives to discover bad news such as corporate wrongdoing, mismanagement, and accounting fraud. For informationally efficient capital markets, the discovery of bad news is as important as the arrival of good news. The CEOs and CFOs of a firm have all the incentives to release good news. It is the short sellers, and sometimes the regulators, who are in the business of discovering bad news and making markets more efficient in the process. Improved information efficiency that comes from the discovery of bad news helps good corporations separate themselves from bad ones. In the end, such a separation allows fundamentally strong firms to raise capital at an attractive rate.\u00a0", "Months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, short seller David Einhorn made a famous speech describing some accounting\u00a0", "discrepancies", "\u00a0in Lehman\u2019s 2008Q1 accounting statements. In September of the year, the truth came out, and Lehman's failure was for everyone to see. Early and accurate discovery of negative information can help investors, regulators, and CFOs alike. Academic research finds overwhelming evidence supporting the positive role short sellers play in\u00a0", "improving market efficiency", ".\u00a0", "There are two other benefits of short selling that go beyond the discovery of bad news. Fearing these discoveries by short sellers, firms are likely to be more careful with their disclosures and corporate decisions in the first place. With their backs against the wall, corporate managers are likely to make better decisions when faced with heavy short-selling pressures. Such a disciplining effect improves the overall quality of corporate reporting, and it can also result in better performance in the long run. Tesla\u2019s recent performance can be partly attributed to this disciplining effect of short sellers.\u00a0", "Second, short sellers play a vital role in keeping price bubbles under control. Stock investors can be broadly classified into two groups: optimists and pessimists. Optimists, who are bullish on the firm's prospects, can easily voice their opinion by buying more shares of the company, contributing to further price rise. Pessimists, on the other hand, can only voice their opinion by selling shares. In the absence of short selling, a pessimistic investor can only voice her opinion if she already has the stock in her portfolio. Therefore, a restriction on short selling activities will significantly decrease their ability to incorporate their views in the stock price. As a result, the stock price will reflect the views of optimistic investors only, potentially creating an unsustainable price bubble.", "GameStop's share price has experienced large swings in recent months. If short sellers are unable to borrow and short the company's stock, there is a possibility that the price level only reflects the opinion of bullish investors. Therefore, the share price can be artificially inflated. Only time will tell whether the current price level is justified or not. Still, we certainly need some short sellers to ensure prices are close to the fundamental value, reflecting both optimists' and pessimists' views.", "There is always a concern that short sellers may not be investing based on fundamental information; instead, they may be trying to manipulate the stock price through their trading. Such manipulative short selling is undoubtedly harmful to the markets. We need better regulation to curb manipulative practices. But, as a whole, there is a lot to gain from short sellers in a vibrant capital market."], "clicks": 6505},

Early on Tesla ruled out Autopilot being on, though confusion over its state and use by the driver may have played a role. The crash caused a fire which, like many battery electric vehicle fires, was complex to control. While Tesla got some data, a flash card in the car\u2019s black box has yet to be examined by them.", "Moravy uses very confusing language in his statements. In one statement he appears to refer to the crashed car. In other statements, it could be read he\u2019s talking about a second test car driven on the same road. There\u2019s no clarification on this matter as yet.", "On the call, Lars Moravy, VP of Engineering, stated that:", "(Update: An earlier version of this story presumed Moravy was describing things learned about the crashed car, as he said he was reporting, and not the ambiguity over which of his statements refer to findings about the crashed car and which refer to a presumed second car used for experiments. This is now confirmed in NTSB reports.)", "The language Tesla uses is unclear. They describe the actions of ACC in the past tense, saying \u201cACC engaged\u201d making it unclear if they refer to data from their car logs, or an experiment done with another car on the same road. They state only that Autosteer (Autopilot) was not engaged, and make no statement that about ACC in the crashed car. It is possible, but odd, that they would not have data on whether ACC was engaged in the same log that revealed that Autopilot was not engaged.", "Presumably that flash card will reveal more useful details, such as when belts where buckled and unbuckled, when pedals were pressed, perhaps when weight sensors or other sensors indicated movement. This Tesla model S does not feature a camera that sees the occupants the way newer models do.", "This adds weight by my earlier speculation that perhaps the driver wanted to demonstrate Autopilot, but activated only ACC, thinking that Autopilot had been activated, or activated nothing at all. Activating ACC results in a different sound and display, but obviously mistakes were made here. A foolish person might attempt to activate the system with a pole pressed to the pedal. Or activate it with the foot and then move to another seat.", "Several things still don\u2019t add up, however:", "At this point few reasonable explanations fit the available facts, so we must await more. As before, though, there is no direct involvement of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot function with this accident, other than the ways in which its existence may have prompted the owner of the car to act recklessly. One such way would be to attempt to show off Autopilot but instead engage only the ACC. Normally in that situation it\u2019s pretty clear this has happened. It\u2019s not unusual in driving a Tesla to attempt to turn on Autopilot and have it fail and issue a warning because the street, like this one, is not accepted by the system as suitable. Drivers are told to keep hands on the wheel, and if you get this warning, your would normally just keep driving. ", "We don\u2019t know for sure who was driving. If it was Dr. Varner, the owner of the car found dead in the back seat, he would have been familiar with engaging both ACC and Autopilot and what to do. If it was his guest, Mr. Talbot, he might not have been familiar. We might speculate that Mr. Tablot could possibly have crashed the car and, due to fire on the driver\u2019s side, moved to the passenger seat to escape but did not get further. Moving to the rear seat would not be impossible, but a challenge for an injured person. More data is needed to consider these questions.", "If ACC had no involvement (which one would imagine Tesla should have data on, and if not, it will be extracted soon from the car\u2019s internal logs) it\u2019s still confusing how the people ended up in the two seats they were in, and why the investigators were so certain they did not move. With no ACC, this could be explained as somebody simply trying out the car\u2019s Ludicrous acceleration mode on a short street and driving into a tree, with odd motions after the crash.", "This leaves us with:", "The biggest issue before the public, however, is if advanced driving features like the Telsa\u2019s are to blame for the accident, and if their design should be changed to prevent this. It\u2019s very hard to figure out how to design systems to be impenetrable to deliberate attempts to override safeguards. You can make more safeguards, but they will not be perfect, and they may cause problems of their own. For example, it is reported that Tesla features will not activate if nobody is triggering the weight sensor in the driver\u2019s seat, but they don\u2019t deactivate if the weight goes away. You don\u2019t want a system to disengage if the weight disappears, that would be the worst thing to do in such a situation, and you must tolerate short interruptions of the weight sensor as can come in bumps or people lifting themselves to adjust clothing. A system might perhaps move to slow down and pull off if the weight vanishes for too long and there is no input. ", "That\u2019s quite a fancy feature for a cruise control, however. Original cruise controls were very simple, and even the advanced ones in many cars today will still do nothing about a car driving off the road into a tree if the driver ignores this. It seems most of them could also have any safety measures defeated without much trouble \u2014 though it\u2019s important to consider most are so simple that nobody would be motivated to try. A false belief that the system will handle all problems might motivate people to defeat safety measures. This is the paradox of quality: The better you make a system, more more likely it is it might be abused, and we feel motivated to punish a system with extra requirements for the sin of being better.", "Tesla could make use of the inward facing camera present in newer models. Such use raises many privacy concerns, and is further complicated by the fact that AI computer vision techniques have reliability and computing cost issues. For many, it\u2019s a move from technology that serves the owner to technology that constrains them. No one answer is clear.", "Read/leave comments here"], "clicks": 4105},

In such a way, social media acts as a barometer of public opinion towards an organisation, and thereby enables finance professionals to get early warning of trouble on the horizon.", "A loose shorthand for ESG therefore is to think of it as an \u2018ethics\u2019 score for an organisation, but the central weakness of ESG is the question of ", "whose", " ethics we are judging corporations on?", "In this way, ESG can be thought of as the western version of social credit for corporates. Social Credit systems are much maligned in the west, as they are often seen as an Orwellian attempt by the Chinese authorities to control their populace. While reports of their sophistication and efficacy are grossly overplayed in the popular news, the system is an alluring glimpse into a future where automation and AI might create an abundance of goods and services and therefore what remains scarce might need to be allocated in an alternative manner to the monetary system we know today.", "With social credit, the value of money is eroded. Let\u2019s use an example. There will only ever be a limited number of high-rise apartments that face sunrise in Shanghai. If the ability to rent such an apartment is limited to only those with a very high social credit score, then the cost becomes a secondary factor. This creates a dynamic where more wealthy but less virtuous citizens are limited in choice to the lower floors that face the cold north. Similarly with first-class rail tickets (the Chinese have a vastly superior rail network to the US, and so railways are their airways). There are only ever so many comfortable seats at the front of the train. If access to these carriages are allocated on merit not wealth, then money becomes a secondary consideration - and the pursuit of wealth perhaps a less appealing goal.", "To be sure, it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to see the dystopian effects of such a system. How your social credit score is created is something of a black-box (much as the case with ESG), and rumours that it can be effected by certain innocuous behaviours are likely to create the type of self-sensorship that we in the west find so abhorant to our value of personal freedom. That said, given the absence in the west of a viable alternative to money when automation passes the tipping point, social credit stacks up as an alternative to UBI schemes as a means of allocating scarce resources on merit rather than capital.", "The flaw with social credit, just as with mainstream-ESG is the tendancy towards a unilateral standard. The poor correlation of ESG-scores from different providers is seen as a bug in the system that needs to be fixed. As ESG data starts to cast judgment on the activities and behaviours of corporates (as it has with Tesla most recently), we are in danger of conflating the ethical assessment of a small few on a company as the universal ethical assessment for us all.", "Elon\u2019s decision to backtrack on the acceptance of crypto as payment seems motivated by this flaw in ESG. As pressure to downgrade Tesla has mounted, so the spectre of more expensive capital has become a likely prospect to face. The crypto markets are still too volatile to be a credible capital market alternative - and so faced with the choice, ESG or crypto - ESG has (for now) been the victor. The plethora of alt-coins in the market has however taught us one thing - personalisation is a quality valued highly around the world. If ESG can bend to being more personalised, then perhaps there can still be an opportunity for visionaries like Elon to pursue an unconventional strategy, and not be so badly penalised for doing so.", "My prediction?

Driver profiles are seamlessly integrated into the Tesla experience, which makes the car an extension of the driver and allows each person to drive the car in the way they want and that is most comfortable to them.\u00a0", "Many cars feature tablets on them\u2014but they don\u2019t work\u2014the cars are not smart. Half the time they can\u2019t find your phone. Connecting your bluetooth is nothing short of a nightmare. Tesla\u2019s user experience just destroys the competition. ", "2 . Data-Driven Design", "Tesla leads the industry in integrated data, largely from its test fleet of fully self-driving cars. Each car picks up movements from numerous sensors, which it then connects to create a full picture of the driving experience. That data helps create a powerful navigation system and strengthens Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, but it also provides valuable insights on customers.\u00a0", "Tesla has an incredibly strong understanding of who its customers are\u2014both as a whole and individually. By understanding each customer, what they are looking for in a driving experience and why they chose Tesla, the company can tailor the experience and change how the car drives to best meet their needs. A busy professional with a long commute will have different needs and therefore a different driving experience than a mom driving her kids around town. By staying in tune with data, Tesla can regularly update its offerings, finetune its software and build experiences and features that resonate with each user.\u00a0", "3 . Dynamic Personalization", "Unlike many other car companies, Tesla aims to create a fluid system that can be updated as systems improve. Most other cars include dashboards with physical buttons that never change, Tesla has a", "\u00a0fully upgradable dash", ". That means that as the software improves over time, the entire driver experience can also evolve and improve.\u00a0 ", "The fluid dashboard and internal software open the door to dynamic personalization, which is the next wave of innovative personalization. Tesla has a patent to use the existing interior-facing cameras in its Model 3 to recognize occupants and automatically apply personalized settings. The dynamic personalization approach takes it a step further than the current driver profiles by sensing who is in the car and making the necessary adjustments for an automatically personalized experience.\u00a0", "Tesla CEO and visionary ", "Elon Musk", " put it this way: \u201cYou\u2019ll probably want dynamic personalization, so it\u2019s like you step into the car, it knows who you are, it knows everything you want, and the car reconfigures itself automatically to all your preferences. So you could step into any car, and that\u2019s how it would be.\u201d\u00a0", "Tesla hasn\u2019t officially launched dynamic personalization yet, but the framework is in place for it to be functioning soon. Just like many other aspects of car manufacturing, Tesla again leads the charge with innovative personalization.\u00a0", "Tesla isn\u2019t just the fastest growing car company, it\u2019s ", "the fastest growing company", " in the world.

While the company should see strong growth ahead, Tesla\u2019s guidance of 50% annual growth in deliveries over a multi-year horizon looks aggressive, given the increasing competition from not just mainstream automakers, but also new entrants into the EV space. Moreover, there are concerns regarding the company\u2019s business in China, which has come under scrutiny from regulators amid local reports of quality and safety issues. Tesla is counting heavily on the country to drive growth (sales in China more than doubled last year). In April, Tesla\u2019s wholesale sales of its made-in-China vehicle declined 27% in April versus March to about 26k units, while over half the sales were related to exports, leading to questions surrounding domestic demand. Tesla\u2019s relative lack of profitability from its core automotive business is also a concern.

Although there hasn\u2019t been much news specific to the company, growth stocks, in general, are being impacted by rising bond yields and fears of higher inflation. Stocks are valued based on discounted future cash flows, and through the ultra-low interest rate environment following Covid-19, investors likely cared less about whether profits were available today or out in the future. This benefited growth stocks such as Tesla, which rallied by about 8x in 2020. However, with Covid-19 cases on the decline and vaccines being rolled out, investors are more optimistic about the economic recovery, pushing up bond yields. The 10-year U.S. Treasury rate has jumped from about 1.1% to about 1.6% in just about a month and this is likely causing investors to re-allocate funds to more cyclical and value stocks.", "So is Tesla stock poised to fall further or could it see a recovery?

Although the stock still looks pricey, trading at about 135x consensus 2021 earnings, Tesla could quickly grow into this valuation if it executes well. During its most recent earnings call, Tesla said that it expects to grow deliveries at a CAGR of 50% a year over a multi-year horizon, meaning that it could possibly be selling almost 40x the number of vehicles it currently does by 2030 if it sustains such a growth rate. While a lot of things need to fall into place for Tesla to grow to these numbers, the company has shown that it is capable of quickly expanding manufacturing capacity, with its Shanghai plant going online in record time, and its factories in Texas and Berlin commencing production sometime this year.
